# Week 1 Project: Build Grab Landing Page (Desktop)

**Due:** Monday, April 23th at 10pm

**Overview:** Build Grab [landing page](https://www.grab.com/vn/en/) from scratch using only HTML and CSS. The landing page does not have to be responsive because we will cover Responsive Web Design in week 2. This landing page is similar to the Spotify landing page that you did in Lab 1.

## User Stories
The following user stories **must** be completed:
* [ ] Top navigation bar with dropdown buttons
* [ ] Banner with background image, white text, and a green button
* [ ] Color or text change when mouse hovers over
* [ ] At least 3 different body sections with different background images or colors
* [ ] 2 (or 3) card items per row in a body section
* [ ] Footer with social icons that link to the actual social pages

## Tips
* The landing page does not have to be exactly the same as the original landing page as long as it can satisfy the above user stories. You can be creative and make it better than the original! 
* Do list out all the additional things that you have added to your landing page

## Advanced
The following advanced user stories are **optional**. You are not required to do these, but you will learn more from doing them: 
* [ ] Add favicon to the page
* [ ] Bootstrap carousel for banner
* [ ] Banner with background video
* [ ] Animation on an element
* [ ] Navigation, contact, sitemap, privacy policy, term of use, etc in footer

## Submission
Submitted through GitHub, 
  * Be sure to **include a README** containing a GIF walkthrough of your app.
