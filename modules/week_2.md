# Week 2 Resources: Responsive Design with Bootstrap
Last week we learned about HTML and CSS, the two core technologies that make up websites. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structure of the webpage, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the visual and layout of the webpage. 

We learned what make up an HTML element: start tag, content, and end tag. We know the difference between normal elements vs. empty elements (self-closing element), or the difference between inline vs. block elements. 

We learned about CSS selectors and CSS properties, how we can use `class` to apply styling to a group of elements, or how we can use `id` to apply styling to a unique element. We also learned about [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) (content, margin, border, and padding) and [CSS Positioning](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position/) (static, relative, absolute, fixed, etc.) concepts that help you to understand how HTML elements are arranged and placed in a *viewport* of a web browser.

This week, we will learn how we can design websites that make them responsive. **Responsive web design** is an approach suggests that any design and development should respond to the user’s behavior based on screen size, platform and orientation. Websites with responsive design look good on any devices (phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops). We will again be using only HTML and CSS to design responsive websites. 

The things will be going over today in class:
* @media queries with breakpoints (mobile first)
* Coding practices
* [Bootsrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework 
    - Why using Bootstrap? 
    - Bootstrap Grid system (container, row, column)
    - Bootstrap components
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - to publish your webpages online
