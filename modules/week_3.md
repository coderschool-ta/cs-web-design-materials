# Week 3 Resources -  Design Thinking with The Wallet Project
Up to this point, you should have a good grasp on how responsive websites are built from scratch, and a clear understanding of how the web works fundamentally. However, knowing all the tecnical requirements for building a site is not enough, you will also need to know how to create the **best experience** for your visitors.

This week, we will take a deep dive into the UI/UX aspects of building a website. UI and UX are the two crucial elements that make up a great product, and they work closely together.

UI (User Interface) is the interaction between the user and the interface of your product. UI Design relates to everything you see, touch, and hear within a website (or a piece of software). 

UX (User Experience) is the experience that a user has when they interact with every aspect of a product. UX Design relates to the usability, accessibility, and satisfaction provided in the interaction with the product

In our lecture today, we will work on a popular challenge called "The Wallet Project". It is a design thinking project from [Stanford d.school](https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/4dbb2/the_wallet_project.html) in which participants pair up, learn about each others’ wallets, brainstorm, and prototype **ONE** new *useful and meaningful* wallet for both.
